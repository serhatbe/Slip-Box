# Using Foam as Zettelkasten  

*Zettlr* has been acting up after the last update, and I'm exploring new tools such as [[Foam]] also see [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/)

[[Zettlr]] 

Foam is a collection VS Code extensions and recipes that power up the editor
into a full-blown note-taking or zettelkasten system. This folder contains user documentation
describing how to get started using Foam, what its main features are, and
strategies for getting the most out of Foam. The full docs are included in the
`foam-template` repo that most users start from.
