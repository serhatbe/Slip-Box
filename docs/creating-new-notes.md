# Creating New Notes

- Write out a new `[[wikilink]]` and `Cmd` + `Click` to create a new file and enter it.
  - For keyboard navigation, use the 'Follow Definition' key `F12` (or [remap the 'editor.action.revealDefinition' key binding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) to something more ergonomic)
- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` for Windows), execute `Foam: Create Note` and enter a **Title Case Name** to create `Title Case Name.md`
  - Add a keyboard binding to make creating new notes easier. See [[commands]] for more info on this.
  - The [[note-templates]] used by this command can be customized.
- You shouldn't worry too much about categorizing your notes. You can always [[search-for-notes]], and explore them using the [[graph-visualization]]. [[graph-visualization]]
