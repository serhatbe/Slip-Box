An exothermic process releases energy. The opposite of an exothermic process is an endothermic process, one that absorbs energy. A good workflow is like an exothermic reaction in which we're energized by the work we generate. A poor workflow is like an endothermic process in which we're deprived of energy and the work drags on.  @ahrensHowTakeSmart2022 [].

Good workflow → virtuous cycle.\
Poor workflow → vicious cycle.
