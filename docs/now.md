## Rest, Reflect, Re-charge and Re-calibrate
Currently on a break from work. Using this time to study[^shawLearnPythonHard2017] @shawLearnPythonHard2017 [], read[^isaacsonLeonardoVinci2017] @isaacsonLeonardoVinci2017 [], and work on some personal projects.

<!-- ## Wordpress

I've finished backing up old Wordpress site 1 to my local drive, two more sites to go. 

<!-- ## Work

Very productive period, finishing projects, one after another.

## Health & Fitness

Gained 2 kg after vacation!

## Books

I'm reading • Learn Python 3 the Hard Way by @shawLearnPythonHard2017 [] • On the Shortness of Life by @senecaShortnessLifeOther1997 [] and • In My Own Way: An Autobiography by @wattsMyOwnWay2007a []

## Music

I'm still learning to play [White Christmas](https://serhatbe.github.io/thedeepkeel/posts/2023-12-10/) on the guitar and listening to [Big Lazy](http://www.biglazymusic.com/new-album), [Muse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_(band)#Musical_style) and [Karsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karsu).
